  <!-- Headings - Content should be broken up by headings in h elements to make pages easy to navigate/scan -->
  

  <!-- Meaningful, Descriptive Link Text - Don't use meaningless phrases like "Click Here" for your link text, it should describe what the link actually goes to -->
  

  <!-- Semantic, Valid HTML - Minimize use of meaningless div and span elements, use semantic elements like section or nav instead. Make sure your HTML validates to modern specs -->


  <!-- Font Size & Readability - Unofficial mininum 16px font size for body text, but also watch out for your text readability dependent on styling -->

  <!-- Color Contrast Ratio - 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio, though aim for better. Ensure your text color isn't too close to your background color, making it hard to read. Some exceptions apply for large text -->

  <!-- Alt Tags on Images - All images should have alt tags filled out describing the purpose of the image -->

  <!-- Large Click Targets - 44px by 44px minimum size for clickable things, with a few exceptions such as inline text links -->

  <!-- Remove Images Of Text - Use actual HTML text instead of using an image of text--text in images cannot be understood by assistive technologies -->

  <!-- Don't Hide Focus Indicator - It's possible to remove/override the default browser focus indicator with the CSS :focus pseudo element or outline: 0; style, which can make it difficult to see what element is active -->
